# react children toggler

The goal of this repo is to provide an example how React.Children might be used to build reusable and easy-to-use component wrappers.

The beauty of this approach is a simplicity of usage, please, check the code below: that is all what is needed for a Toggler to work:
```
  <Toggler>
    <button>toggle</button>
    <div>Content goes here...</div>
  </Toggler>
```
